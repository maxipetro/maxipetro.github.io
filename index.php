    <p>I am a PhD at student at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca">Western University</a> interested in (higher) category theory, logic and type theory and homotopical algebra. My supervisors are Chris Kapulkin (Department of Mathematics) and John Bell (Department of Philosophy). I obtained a MSc in Mathematics from Western and an MA in Philosophy from <a href="https://www.usi.ch/en/education/master/philosophy">Università della Svizzera italiana, Lugano, Switzerland</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Currently, I am working on the interpretation and semantics of univalent dependent type theories in infinity-categories. Part of my research is developing a semantic framework for univalent type theories in elementary infinity toposes. These type theories are also sometimes summarised under the name ‘Homotopy Type Theory’.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am also interested in higher category theory and homotopical algebra in general, in studying different models of infinity categories and studying model categories. On the philosophical side, I am interested in constructive mathematics.</p>
